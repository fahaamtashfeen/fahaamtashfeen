# About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on school projects and personal projects (currently focused on a functional MERN stack ecommerce store)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning audio development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on audio dev projects and robotics projects. Really anything actually, I find plenty of curiousity in many topics so if you have something, please reach out
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything and everything, I'm always learning
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a music producer as well! I've mainly produced rap and r&b but I love producing a wide variety. Ask me about some tracks I've produced and people I've worked with!
